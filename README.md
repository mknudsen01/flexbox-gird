# flexbox-gird

Yeah, I know, it's another darn flexbox grid. It's not going to try to do a ton for you, but it should be able to handle most basic layout needs.

Just copy and paste the `grid.css` code into your styles, cool? 

Basically, have a `container` grandparent, `row` parent, and `col--[SIZE]` children.

```html
<section class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col--6">
      <!-- your lovely content -->
    </div>
    <div class="col--6">
      <!-- your lovely content -->
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```
